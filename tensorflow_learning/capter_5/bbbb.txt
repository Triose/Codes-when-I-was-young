The number of layers does not indicates a higher accuracy of one model
I implement the "example_code" with 2 hidden layer but the result accuracy is about 11% or worst
I don't understand why this happens 
I will add an explaination after I figure out it

Answer: MNIST handwrite dataset describes a simple question which does not need a complex nerual network to solve it, as a result, a more complicated nerual network won't equals a more accurate result
